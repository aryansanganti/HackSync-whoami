Use the --verbose flag to see more details about passed checks.

✖ Check for common project setup issues
Multiple lock files detected (yarn.lock, package-lock.json). This may result in unexpected behavior in CI environments, such as EAS Build, which infer the package manager from the lock file.
Advice:
Remove any lock files for package managers you are not using.

✖ Check native tooling versions
CocoaPods version check failed. CocoaPods may not be installed or there may be an issue with your CocoaPods installation. Installing version 1.15.2 or higher is recommended.
Advice:
Update your native tooling to the recommended versions.

✖ Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.json, indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, EAS Build will not sync the following properties: orientation, icon, scheme, userInterfaceStyle, ios, android, plugins, androidStatusBar. 

Advice:
Add '/android' and '/ios' to your .gitignore file if you intend to use CNG / Prebuild. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild/#usage-with-eas-build

✖ Validate packages against React Native Directory package metadata
The following issues were found when validating your dependencies against React Native Directory:
  No metadata available: aes-js
Advice:
Update React Native Directory to include metadata for unknown packages. Alternatively, set expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.listUnknownPackages in package.json to false to skip warnings about packages with no metadata, if the warning is not relevant.

4 checks failed, indicating possible issues with the project.
